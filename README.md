# C-A-Landers-Thesis

## Description

This repository contains only commands and scripts modified from or not provided by the original pipeline, which can be found [here](https://github.com/CGSbioinfo/RNASeq_pipeline) 

Its purpose is to provide commands and scripts not available elsewhere and to highlight modifications made by the author \(C A Landers\). All additional, explanatory code comments have been added either during construction of code or to aid in its modification - large sections of some scripts have thus been left uncommented.
