# C-A-Landers-Thesis

## Description

This repository contains only commands and scripts modified from or not provided by the original pipeline, which can be found [here](https://github.com/CGSbioinfo/RNASeq_pipeline) 

Its purpose is to provide commands and scripts not available elsewhere and to highlight modifications made by the author \(C A Landers\). All additional, explanatory code comments have been added either during construction of code or to aid in its modification - large sections of some scripts have thus been left uncommented. 

## Comments
Scripts and commands related to the same step of analysis are provided in the same document

Each set of scripts/commands is provided with the following information
1. Designer/s : Individual/s who designed the original scripts/commands
2. Description : Basic description of the purpose of the scripts/commands
3. Indications of the purpose of individual scripts/commands where more than one is provided in a single document

All other information is provided within code comments, including which sections/lines of code were modified by the author \(C A Landers\)

All code is within the Python environment unless otherwise indicated
